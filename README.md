# QAcousticCamera

Scanning holographic acoustic camera based on 
locked-in detection of the signal from a microphone
that is scanned across the field of view by an
Arduino-driven polargraph. This illustration of the GUI
interface shows the phase of a 5 kHz sound wave from a stereo
speaker, including reflections from nearby surfaces.
